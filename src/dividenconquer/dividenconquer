Divide and conquer is a strategical approach to solve a main problem by solving its sub problem and combining the
solution of all sub problems to get the solution of tha main problem.

DAC(problem){
    if(sub_problem_solvable){
        return solution_of_sub_problem
    } else {
        divide_main_problem_to_sub_problem by p1, p2, p3, p4 ... pk
        apply DAC(p1), DAC(p2), ... DAC(pk)
        combine (DAC(p1), DAC(p2), ... DAC(pk)) for_the_main_problem_solution
    }
}

These kind of problems are recursive in nature.
Major recursive algorithm problems are;

1. Binary Search
2. Tower of Hanoi
3. Finding Maximum and Minimum
4. Quick Sort
5. Merge Sort
6. Strassen's Matrix multiplication
7. Palindrome
8. Factorial etc...
